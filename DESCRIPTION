Description: Functionality for developing and analyzing the output of health-economic 
    simulation models. Contains random sampling functions for conducting probabilistic  
    sensitivity analyses and individual patient simulations. Individualized 
    cost-effectiveness analysis can be performed on simulation output and used to 
    summarize a probabilistic sensitivity analysis at the subgroup or individual 
    level. Core functions are written in C++ to facilitate computationally 
    intensive modeling.
