`hesim` is an R package for implementing and analyzing health-economic simulation models. It is currently under development and new features will continue to be added.

The package currently supports:

* Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis (e.g. probabilistic sensitivity analysis) at the subgroup level.

Future versions will also support:

* Running very fast patient-level and cohort simulation models.
* Analyzing the outcomes of both discrete and continuous time simulations.
