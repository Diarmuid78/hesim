# Introduction
This page compares the computational performance of `hesim` against other `R` packages that have been used to develop health economic models for health technology assessment. We provide benchmarks for both a semi-Markov model and a time-inhomogeneous Markov model. 

The following `R` packages and scripts are used. The file `benchmarks.R` contains the code used to run the models.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}

library("flexsurv")
library("ggplot2")
library("heemod")
library("hesim")
library("kableExtra")
library("mstate")

# Semi-Markov models
[Williams et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X16651869) adapted the [`mstate`](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v038i07) package to simulate parametric semi-Markov multi-state models. Here, we use simulate a 6-state model for leukemia patients following bone marrow transplantation with both `hesim` and `mstate`. Since a semi-Markov process is assumed, an individual-level simulation is used. Additional details were previously provided in a [blog post](https://devinincerti.com/2019/01/01/sim-mstate.html).

We fit a parametric Weibull model, but note that computational performance does not differ substantially across parametric distributions. We also checked the performance of a spline model, which can be used to model very flexible baseline hazards, but is slower because the quantile function must be computed numerically and `hesim`, by default, uses inverse transform sampling to randomly sample from survival splines. To facilitate direct comparison with the Weibull model, we used a parameterization of the spline equivalent to a Weibull distribution. When using `mstate`, multi-state models are simulated using a cumulative hazard function estimated on a discrete grid, so a time step must be defined. We used a step size of 1/52 (i.e., one week) so that each time step was a week long. This produced reasonably accurate state probability estimates that were similar to those performed in continuous time with `hesim` (see plot below).

```{r}
DIST = "weibull"
STEP = 1/52
```

We began by simulating "deterministic" models assuming no parameter uncertainty. Comparisons of state probabilities simulated using 5,000 patients with `hesim` and `mstate` are shown in the plot.

```{r, SemiMarkov, cache = CACHE}
smb1 <-  benchmark_semi_markov(n_patients = 1000, uncertainty = "none", dist = DIST,
                               step = STEP)
smb2 <-  benchmark_semi_markov(n_patients = 5000, uncertainty = "none", dist = DIST,
                               step = STEP)
smb2$plot
``` 

We then performed probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and varied both the number of patients simulated and the number of draws of the parameters. Run times are reported in the table below. `hesim` is considerably faster and the speed advantage is most notable when a PSA is performed. Although slower than the Weibull model, the spline model is still fast, meaning that flexible baseline hazards can be modeled if required with only a small negative impact on performance.

```{r, semiMarkovPSA, cache = CACHE}
smb <- list(
  smb1,
  smb2,
  benchmark_semi_markov(n_patients = 1000, uncertainty = "normal", 
                        n_samples = 100, dist = DIST,
                        step = STEP),
  benchmark_semi_markov(n_patients = 1000, uncertainty = "normal", 
                        n_samples = 1000, dist = DIST,
                        step = STEP)
)
```

```{r, semiMarkovTable}
semi_markov_table(smb)
```

# Markov models
[`heemod`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/index.html) is a general purpose `R` package for simulating Markov cohort models. We simulated the 5-state time inhomogeneous Markov model of total hip replacement from the [*Decision Modeling for Health Economic Evaluation*](https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/decision-modelling-for-health-economic-evaluation) textbook with `hesim` and `heemod`. Vignettes for this example are available in both packages ( [`hesim`](https://hesim-dev.github.io/hesim/articles/markov-inhomogeneous-cohort.html), [`heemod`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/d_non_homogeneous.html)).

Cohort models were simulated with both packages and an individual-level model was also simulated with `hesim`. A single representative patient was used in the cohort model and 1000 patients were simulated in the individual-level model. The cohort models were simulated for 60 years using cycle lengths of 1 year.

```{r MarkovPSA, message = FALSE, cache = CACHE}
mb <- list(
  benchmark_markov(n_samples = 10, n_patients = 1000),
  benchmark_markov(n_samples = 100, n_patients = 1000),
  benchmark_markov(n_samples = 1000, n_patients = 1000)
)
```

```{r, MarkovTable}
markov_table(mb)
